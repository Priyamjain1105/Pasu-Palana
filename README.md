## 🔗 Introduction

**Pasu Pālaṇā** (पशु पालणा) is a project dedicated to enhancing the management of shelters and gaushalas that care for abandoned and neglected animals. With a focus on technology-driven solutions, it empowers caretakers to efficiently track critical details about the animals they serve, such as health records, disease histories, treatments, and overall well-being.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

Animals like cows, goats, and others are often abandoned when they are no longer "useful" to humans, left to suffer from disease or hunger. Gaushalas and animal shelters tirelessly save and care for these animals but lack efficient tools for record management. 

### Goals:
- 📝 **Track animal details**: Species, breed, gender, and health status.
- ⚕️ **Monitor health**: Disease history, treatments, and medical updates.
- 🔄 **Ease of use**: Simple and intuitive interface for caretakers.
- 🏆 **Scalability**: Expandable for features like adoptions, volunteers, and donations.
